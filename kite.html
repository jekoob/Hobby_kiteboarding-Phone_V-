				<u><b>What is kiteboarding</b></u>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Kiteboarding, also known as kitesurfing, is a water sport that blends elements and characteristics of wakeboarding, surfing, windsurfing, snowboarding, paragliding, and skateboarding.
				Harnessed to a large hand-controlled kite and powered by the wind, the kiteboarder uses a board (similar to a snowboard, wakeboard, or skateboard) to ride and glide across the water.
				Kiteboarders are only able to fly their kites through an imaginary wind window. Unlike in windsurfing and other sailing disciplines, kiteboarders need minimum wind speed to get their wings up in the sky.
